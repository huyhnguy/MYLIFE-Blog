## Why?

The main purpose of this project was to practice setting up an API and accessing it from the outside. This project also gave me experience with
- RESTful organization
- Protecting routes with authentication
- Using a rich text editor (TinyMCE)
- Deploying a backend API, and a separate frontend
- React
- Following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
- Responsive Design
